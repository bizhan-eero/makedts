-- A script that turned the ASCII codes output by makedts into hex
codes, an additional function can match makedts' output with fdtdump's
on a node-by-node basis.

-- The matching function could produce a "diff" output between a set of DTS and DTSI source files and a reverse-compiled binary.

-- These functions could then answer the question, "Can this set of
DTS files produce this DTB file?"
